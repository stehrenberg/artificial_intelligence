* Version History
*********************************************************

v1.2.8
- Officially supported the NodeInformation class.  Please
  read the tutorial about how to use it with your agent.
- Removed "getHeuristic()," "setHeuristic()," "getPathCost(),"
  and "setPathCost()" from the Node class because of confusion
  about how they were designed to be used.  Instead, read the
  tutorial about using the NodeInformation class for path costs
  and use SBFunctions.getDistanceToGoal() for heuristics.

v1.2.7
- Fixed a bug that would not open a map if the width was
  greater than the height.

v1.2.6
- Added the management of node costs in the movement cost.

v1.2.5
- Added a command-line startup.  Additional arguments are
  as follows:

    - agent_name.class : The agent to load
    - map_name.sbm     : The map file to load
    - delay            : The integer delay value to load

  Usage is the following (all one line):

  java -cp .;BotEnvironment.jar; BotEnvironment.BotEnvironment
  agent_name.class map_name.sbm delay

- Added a developer name to the agent.  The developer name
  will be displayed on the Map windows.
- Allowed agents to be in one subdirectory of the "Agents"
  directory.  For example, Joe Smith can put his agent and
  all the files that the agent uses in "Agents/jsmith".  Just
  be sure to set the package to the same directory.

v1.2.4
- Now when a new agent is chosen, the delay resets itself
  correctly.
- Added a "Quick Start" choice to choose an agent and
  start immediately with SearchMap

v1.2.3
- Fixed a "NullPointerException" that occurred if
  getFringeString() was called on an empty fringe.
- Changed the starting Agent directory to open in the
  "Agents" directory.
- Changed the starting map directory to open in the "Maps"
  directory.

v1.2.2
- Allowed the program to be run either maximized or not.

v1.2.1
- Fixed a bug that let agents move through walls.

v1.2

- Fixed a bug where the map does not respond if a new
  session is started.
- Fixed a bug where the agent does not respond if a new
  map is opened while the bot is auto-stepping.
- The agent log now clears when a map is closed or reset.
- Now when an agent is chosen at the start of a session,
  the class file is chosen instead of the Java file.
- NOTE: A bug was discovered where the agent does not
        respond if the delay is set to zero, auto-stepping
        is on, and a new map is opened.  It is probably
        because of threading issues, but for now, users
        should stop the agent or set the delay to a higher
        value than zero before opening a new map.

v1.1

- Added buttons for stepping, auto-stepping and stopping.
- Added a bar to change the delay between agent steps.
- Embedded the agent log into the GUI rather than having
  it be a window, and subsequently removed the log toggle
  from the View menu.
- Added the option to save the agent log.
- Changed the map legend to not appear when a map is opened.

v1.0

- Initial release.

* Usage Instructions
*********************************************************

Extract BotEnvironment.zip to some directory.  From
the command prompt, go to the directory the zip file was
extracted to and type (for DOS):

java -classpath BotEnvironment.jar;.; BotEnvironment.BotEnvironment

When the program is running, choose File->New Bot Environment Session
From here, choose an agent from the Agents directory (in this case,
MyAgent).  You can load a map by choosing Map->Open Map, then choosing
a map from the "testmaps" directory.  To choose which search to run
and to start traversing the map, use the Bot Menu.

There are two maps that are loaded when a map is chosen; one is
the global map, showing everything, and the other is the agent
map, showing only what the agent has seen.  Also, a legend is
available as well as a window showing what the bot has logged.

*NOTE* Since this program is still under construction, you will
need to manually move the windows around until they are visible.

* Programming Instructions
*********************************************************

Important methods to consider when making your own agent are
as follows:

        getBotLocation():     Returns the Node where the agent is.
        moveForward():        Moves the agent one tile forward in
                              the current direction it is facing.
        turnLeft():           Turns the agent 90 degrees left from
                              the current direction it is facing.
        turnRight():          Turns the agent 90 degrees right from
                              the current direction it is facing.
        turnTo(int):          Turns the agent to the direction given
                              (the integer values for direction are
                              defined in the SBConstants class).
        log(String):          Prints the string in the logging window.
        step():               Each time tick, the agent performs
                              actions as defined in this method.
